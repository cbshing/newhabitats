# Origins Civics Is Country Type Triggers
# by cbshing
# added for future compatibility with Origins Civics
#
#
# Each of these triggers represents various civic archetypes that may trigger varying gameplay elements
# This is used for story quests
# Each Civic can be disabled by commenting out the related "has_valid_civic" line in this code
# And adding an invalid check (such as has_country_flag = invalid_oc_country).
# This would allow for the code to remain the same, but only alter the lines here.
#
#	Example:
# 
#	example_trigger = {
#		is_country_type = default
#		free_leader_slots > 0
#	}
#
#
#	In a script file:
#
#	trigger = {
#		example_trigger = yes
#	}
#

# is type of country

# scope: country 
oc_is_habitat_country = {
	OR = {
		has_country_flag = invalid_oc_country
	}
}

# scope: country 
oc_is_habitat_preference_country = {
	OR = {
		has_country_flag = starts_with_habitat_preference
	}
}
